# Music Expanse

Tired of arguing over music at a party or a gathering? Here, make a
virtual room add people with the unique RoomID, and let the members of
the room control the music through a voting system.

- The Goal of this project is to provide a solution to the abomination
  playing music at parties is, where we keep shouting change the song,
  and other people say don't.

- MusicExpanse solves this problem by introducing **music rooms**
  which the admin creates with a fix **no of votes to skip**.
  Then the room code can be shared to the members at the party to allow them
  to vote on whether to skip the song or not.

- It uses the **Spotify's Rest API** and
  **OAuth** authentication method to provide the song
  playing details and to send request to skip / pause the songs
