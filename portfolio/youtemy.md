- This web app aims to improve learning efficiency and make a
  developer more streamlined and focused towards learning a new
  technology. It helps them keep track of the courses they are
  watching on YouTube

- We initially had thought of developing an extension for this,
  however, our pod leader suggested this could turn into a really good
  web application so we worked in that direction. Youtemy uses the
  **YouTube Data API v3** to present search results and
  present playlists on our web page. The tracking of progress of each
  playlists as well as adding bookmarks is done with the help of
  **Firebase(Firestore)**

- One of the drawbacks of watching educational playlists on YouTube is
  that we are eventually drawn into tutorial hells where we simply
  code along the YouTube creator and donâ€™t wish to push our efforts in
  creating a new project. This hinders our progress. YouTemy aims to
  change that by essentially helping us track the number of playlists
  we have watched for a certain topic. It even keeps track of the
  **percentage of course completed**.

- In case, you want to enroll in a course not offered by us, simply
  search for it in the Explore section and add it to the Enrolled
  Courses and then, it helps us track the number of playlists that we
  are enrolled in, along with the percentage completion of the
  courses. YouTemy also allows us to bookmark videos and playlists for
  future use allowing us to come back to difficult topics when needed
