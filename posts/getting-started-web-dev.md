description: "There is a plethora of videos and blog posts out there discussing how to get started with Web Development, whenever I go to Uni there is at least one person asking this question to me. So I figured the content isn't helping and a potential problem can be those videos and blogs posts discuss the what but not the how. This is what I am gonna try and solve"

## Introduction

In this blog post we're gonna dive into, how one who has zero experience in Web Development can become an **internship ready Web Developer**.

We'll first understand the difference between backend and frontend of a web application, then we'll start by learning the frontend which will include firstly the basics _html_, _css_, and _js_.

Once we're done with these we'll have choice to move further with the frontend or start exploring the backend I'll recommend moving forward with a _Frontend JavaScript Framework_ like _react.js_, or one can move forward with a _Backend JavaScript Framework_ like _express.js_

### Why Web-Development?

Then answer to this question is fairly straight forward, Web Development has proven itself to be a valuable skill to learn from time and time again.  
I can tell this by my experience and from the experience of my fellow developers, that the number of opportunities in Web Development is far greater than they are in say Mobile Development or Machine Learning Development. The pay is pretty nice too, although it highly depends on the level of your skill.
The stipend is anywhere from _10k INR_ to _100k INR_ depending on the quality and relevance of the skill you have.

Apart from all this, the barrier to entry for Web Development is comparatively way less. You start to see the result of all that you've been learning quickly which motivates us, we learn more and get more results. This _positive feedback loop_ takes more time to kick in, in other forms of development (say Mobile Development)

All and all, spending time learning web development is going to be extremely rewarding.

### Why JavaScript?

The answer to this question is fairly complicated compared to the previous one. So let's divide it into two parts the _front-end_ and the _back-end_.

**Front End**

If I had to tell someone why they need to learn _JavaScript_ to become a fronted developer in a single line, I would say:  
Because every browser has a _JavaScript Runtime_ built in by default.

JavScript Runtime being the platform on which the _. js_ code is executed. But no one would be using _. js_ if it didn't get the job done, because it does. And there a huge number of _javaScript frameworks_ out there that makes the ecosystem very developer friend (_at least virtually_)

> Even if the web site is built with a framework like **Django** (python) the front-end is still written in **javaScript**

**Back End**

_javaScript_ on the back-end is a different story entirely, there is no default recommendation for the back-end technologies, and using _javaScript_ on the backend is nothing more then a _personal recommendation_

I recommend _javaScript_ for the backend for mainly two reasons, the community is great and the friction is way less. (by friction I mean the context switching one has to do when developing application using two different languages)

**The top 3 _back-end_ frameworks:**

- PHP – Laravel, CakePHP
- Python – Django, Flask
- JavaScript – Express.js, Spring

A newbie can learn either of the above mentioned frameworks for the _back-end_ but my recommendation still lies with _javaScript_, the blog post being about _internship ready web developer_. This statement doesn't mean that these technologies don't have opportunities, it is simply implying the _javaScript_ has more.
With all that out of the way let's dive in.

Don't get anxious looking at all the topics above, I am sorry if they look intimidating. This index is designed to _quick access_ all the _sections_ and _sub-sections_ of the blog-post that corresponds to each of the topics. For some of the topics that are too small to explain I have directly linked resourced to learn them. For example, _How does the internet work, and what is HTTP?_ is directly linked to an **Stanford** web page explaining exactly that.

> **Note:** The first two steps (Basics and Tools) are basically **mandatory (in order)** to move forward with the later steps, however the last two steps (Additional Frontend and Back-End) can be swapped to the interest, whichever interests you more.
