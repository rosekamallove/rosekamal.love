- Why
- What
- From Where
- Major Pit falls
- Not falling into the tutorial hell (by thinking of the solution before hand, then implementing it, and using the video to check our solution)
- Finally creating a project from scratch with Git and Github
- Applying to internships

In this blog post we're gonna dive into, how one who has zero experience in Web Development can become an **internship ready Web Developer**.

We'll first understand the difference between backend and frontend of a web application, then we'll start by learning the frontend which will include firstly the basics _html_, _css_, and _js_.

Once we're done with these we'll have choice to move further with the frontend or start exploring the backend I'll recommend moving forward with a _Frontend JavaScript Framework_ like _react.js_, or one can move forward with a _Backend JavaScript Framework_ like _express.js_

#### Why Web-Development?
