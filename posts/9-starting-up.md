With all the stories the media does about startups these days it is hard to not feel the FOMO. I am literally in my second year of college studying computer science and I feel like I am late in the start up game even though I have my whole life left to do this.

I honestly believe that starting up is not a one time thing, it is a mindset, a way of living, alway thinking about something that could make people's lives better, observing the problems that I am facing and thinking if this is scalable, taking responsibility and not complaining etc, etc I know this all sound bullshit and you maybe thinking that I am a freaking kid what do I know of the world, well I don't but don't you think that this is a very efficient way of learn about the world we live in? I certainly believe so.

It used to be that entrepreneurship was born out of necessity, but now days it has become a hyped up thing to choose. People actively **choose** that we don't wanna do a job, instead we want to start up because it is _**the** cool thing in the markeet_.

So, I have **chosen** to be an entrepreneur, even though I still can't fucking spell it.

## Why tho?

This actually is a pretty interesting story, it was during the MLH Fellowship that my and my team member Ritesh built a nice website which allows the user's to track their learning on YouTube, and minimised distraction. It is called [**YouTemy**](https://youtemy.tech), it allowed us to win the hackathon for which we were building the project. But after the fellowship I shared that project with my friends and thery reaction was "tune banaya hai" which translates to "you made it?!", It honestly gave goosebumbs to me.

Then one day I visited one of my friends and noticed that they were using it when doing a **DSA** playlist on YouTube saying that it truly does shift the learning experience and that his concentration increased. I can't express in words how good I felt seeing that, a shitty website that I built in a fucking hackathon being used as a solution to the problem that we were tyring to solve.

Fast forward to today, I am using it myself too. I was thinking of learning trees and our boy striver has a playlist just for that, so I have been using [**YouTemy**](https://youtemy.tech) for a month now, and it is a piece of shit. A useful piece of shit at that.

My work being useful to real human beings, this was a feeling that I can never forget. It gives meaning to my otherwise pointless life. I love building stuff that real humans with real lives will use, and that is the reason I want to build a good product this time instead of shitty hackathon project.

## Building leverage

This dates back to my JEE mains examination in which I scored a whopping **64th percentile** so was naturally selected in a shit college, where the well TCS and Wipro visit that too sometimes.

But, I had watched some videos on YouTube that this is not the end. I can still get a good placement if work hard for the next 4 years. So that's what I decided to do, obviously it was extremely hard, especially for someone with 64th percentile. Not that I was dumb or anything, I had never in my life worked hard before and going from a lazy piece of shit to a hard working piece of shit is a challenge in itself.

At the same time I was consuming videos about starting up, making big money and providing extreme value to the society. One of my friend Aman Gangwar had gotten into a IIIT and was extremely pationate about starting up, so much so that he don't even want to do a job. But I was not like this, and thank you old Rose for not being like this. The reason I am saying this is because as I mentioned I can't get a good job through my college, I have to go off campus. Off Campus is hard.

So this is what I decided to do, build leverage in the first two years of you college so that you can get a good internship in you third year, and since you have a good internship in you third year and you will have a full 2 years left you can spend that time starting up. And if you are not able to build the leverage in two years then well take three years, or four but getting a job should be your first priority.

That is what I did in my last 2 years, build leverage. And I am proud to say that I have built it, I did MLH Fellowship in my first year then a internship with good pay at a small startup and now, I have been selected as a open source contributor through the Google Summer of Code program. This is all good but DSA is important, so I have also been doing DSA consistently and by the time interview arrive I will be ready.

Guess what does this mean? I can start up without worrying about getting a job.

## My strategy
