Starting up is one of the hardest things that exist in the modern world, as our boi Elon himself said, _starting a company is like eating glass and staring into the abyss_ which for us mere mortals means that we should think a lot before we start chewing on the glass while we stare into the abyss. I mean, it's not healthy.

So, in this blog I will be sharing all of my learnings from the past month which help you (and me) decided whether to start up and if yes, then how to get startup ideas and evaluate them, properly. This way (theoretically) you (and me) will fall in the 10% of the startups that don't fail.

Who's [Paul Grahm](http://paulgraham.com/) you ask? Only the founder of [Y-Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), a successful serial entrepreneur, and the author of **the** [PG's Articles](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html)(which I will reference a lot). Yep, he's a chad and I am very captivated by him.

## Should we startup?

Let's start first by talking if we should or shouldn't startup. Surprisingly enough the points are the same on both sides of the story, the way we look at the is different which dictates the decision of us starting up.

So, like everything else the answer is **It depends.**

![It Depends](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69139607/215490767-0f732de0-254d-4fd1-831b-df093e8aa275.jpg)

It depends, but on what? (tl;dr on our mindset) well to answer this I am going to steal some points from a [PG's Essay](https://www.startupschool.org/curriculum/why-not-to-start-a-startup) on why one shouldn't startup, the points which are applicable to me and then argue on why we should or shouldn't startup.

### 1. Too Young
The very first point that PG points out is that if you're too young you shouldn't startup, the average age for founders is 27 after-all.

With age there comes a sense of maturity, ownership and decision making, but the catch here is that it doesn't only come from age it comes form experience. And the experience has varying quality, in a set of two who has 3 years of experience each it is not certain that both of them will have the same quality of experience. The experience per year is important too.

PG talks about Sam Altman, a 19 year old who is one of the most successful founders in YC. When he talked to him it didn't feel like he was talking to a 19 year old more like a 40 year old inside a body of a 19 year old.

What's more important then being of a certain age is having a certain mindset, of ownership. So that when things don't go as planned you don't go on like oh no I messed up, someone help me. Instead you pull yourself together, take the ownership of the mess and try to clean it up.

I am 19, will be 20 in July so what this means to my mind is that I have full 7 years to become successful as a startup founder. The experience per year that I will gain when working on _building something that people want_ is unmatched if we compare it to the traditional route.

> There's a reason we have a distinct word "adult" for people over a certain age. There is a threshold you cross. It's conventionally fixed at 21, but different people cross it at greatly varying ages. You're old enough to start a startup if you've crossed this threshold, whatever your age.

>  Paul Grahm

We, have another advantage which the people that came before us just didn't had. It's the resources and the market. Everyone is very helpful and the fact that I as a 19YO from a shitty college can write this blog means that there are a lot of resources, and I am not all alone like the people who startup up before us were.

### 2. Too inexperienced

The follow up to the above point is that what if we are too in-experienced, wouldn't that mean that we are not fit to start up? Shouldn't we get some experience, work for a company and then think about startup up?

Yes, absolutely we definitely need experience. But, don't you think instead of working for a company to get the experience we can work on our own and get better experience. According to PG even the founders who's startup didn't came out as a success would do it all over again, because the experience was so good.

I am a college student with a pretty good resume, and 1.5 years of college still left. So, instead of spending this time doing a couple of internship the work where is more or less meaningless. Why don't I start building something that people want won't that be infinitely better than doing those internships?

Don't know about business? we'll learn. Not determined enough? we'll build the grit. No co-founder? we'll find one. No idea? we'll find one. 

Let's just say even if the startup isn't a success I would still have more than zero users on the product which is already better than more than 90% of the students out there who's projects are copied from YouTube tutorials.

As a college student we don't have any responsibility other than getting a job, which won't go anywhere even after one year. We would still be able to land that job. 

I have talked to enough people, and worked in the industry enough to realise that it a job isn't all that great of a choice. It's not even a safe option, the layoffs has proved this point. Do you think you'll be working on something cool even if you get a job at let's say Google? No. There's a very high chance that we are going to be doing the most boring work there is, even as a software engineer.

I talked about this more in my [previous blog about starting up](/blog/1-starting-up)

### 3. A job is a default thing to do

This well is the hardest to get over, I see a lot of people having a mindset that there is nothing after college other then getting a job. I have seen this first-hand with my friends and relatives. It's worse here in India where the status quo is a Government Job, everything else is just bull crap.

The only thing I would like to say on this is that if things don't work out, you'll still be able to get a job. Many companies prefer candidates with startup experience.

## How to get and evaluate startup ideas

Okay, so we have finally decided that we want to start up. But we don't have an idea what should we do.

> The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. It's to look for problems, preferably problems you have yourself.
> 
> Paul Grahm

It is very important to work on a problem that we ourselves have faced because this ensures that the problem really does exist. And well according to people the biggest mistake that startups make is **to work on a problem that doesn't exist**. It may seem easy to think of startup ideas when you are _thinking_ of startup ideas, but the advice that PG gives is very counterintuitive. Instead of thinking of an idea we face a problem and then try to find the solution to that problem, and this solution is the idea.

But instead, we make up a problem in our head that _we think_ people are facing then make up a solution and start building it. This is very wrong on a lot of levels.

> For example, a social network for pet owners. It doesn't sound obviously mistaken. Millions of people have pets. Often they care a lot about their pets and spend a lot of money on them. Surely many of these people would like a site where they could talk to other pet owners. Not all of them perhaps, but if just 2 or 3 percent were regular visitors, you could have millions of users. You could serve them targeted offers and maybe charge for premium features.

The danger of an idea like this is that the people we'll talk to won't say that they would never use it, but instead, say that they might use it. Even when the startup launches, it will sound plausible to a lot of people. They don't want to use it themselves, at least not right now, but they could imagine other people wanting it. Sum that reaction across the entire population, and you have zero users.

### Depth First Search

Yeah, in order to get a good startup idea we have to be narrow-minded. There have to be some users who really need what you are building, not people who might use it but people who really need it and will use it straight away. The number of these people is obviously small so you shouldn't worry about that because if there was something that a large number of people urgently needed, it would've already been built.

> You can either build something a large number of people want a small amount or something a small number of people want a large amount. Choose the latter. Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly all good startup ideas are of that type
>
> Paul Grahm

When you have an idea for a startup, ask yourself: who wants this right now? Who wants this so much that they'll use it even when it's a crappy version made by a two-person startup they've never heard of? If you can't answer that, the idea is probably bad.

Paul Grahm talks about an analogy of a Well and how it is similar to a good startup idea.

You don't need the narrowness of the well per se. It's the depth you need; you get narrowness as a byproduct of optimizing for depth (and speed). But you almost always do get it. In practice, the link between depth and narrowness is so strong that it's a good sign when you know that an idea will appeal strongly to a specific group or type of user.

### How to expand this "well"
Well, PG says that it is not easy to tell if an idea is a part of a huge company or just a niche product. What do we do then? he says that being at the edge of the field helps.

What this means is that if we are at the very edge of the advancement of a particular industry then we can have a hunch if the particular thing is big or not. And to build this hunch.

In _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_, Robert Pirsig says:
> You want to know how to paint a perfect painting? It's easy. Make yourself perfect and then just paint naturally.

Being at the leading edge doesn't mean we have to be the ones pushing it forward we can be at the leading edge as a user too.

Here's a story from PG's Essay:
Being at the leading edge of a field doesn't mean you have to be one of the people pushing it forward. You can also be at the leading edge as a user. It was not so much because he was a programmer that Facebook seemed a good idea to Mark Zuckerberg because he used computers so much. If you'd asked most 40-year-olds in 2004 whether they'd like to publish their lives semi-publicly on the Internet, they'd have been horrified at the idea. But Mark already lived online; to him, it seemed natural.

Paul Buchheit says that people at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field "live in the future." Combine that with Pirsig and you get:
> Live in the future, then build what's missing.

If you're not at the leading edge of some rapidly changing field, you can get to one. For example, anyone reasonably smart can probably get to an edge in programming (e.g. building mobile apps) in a year. Since a successful startup will consume at least 3-5 years of your life, a year's preparation would be a reasonable investment.

### Start noticing

Okay, okay I get what you're saying but how do I use the "living in the future" thing to _get the freaking ideas_? Well, you start noticing the things that are missing.

> If you're really at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field, there will be things that are obviously missing.
> 
> PG

The catch here is that it won't be obvious that they are startup ideas, so not only think about the things that are missing also _don't_ think about whether or not this could be a big company. You will have plenty of time to apply tests and think about this later, but if you start thinking about it it may end up filtering out some good ideas and get you interested in some of the bad ones.

> Most things that are missing will take some time to see. You almost have to trick yourself into seeing the ideas around you.
> 
> PG

The ideas are out there. It is impossible that the technologies have stopped progressing and **all** of the problems to be solved are already solved. In the future if these problems that _you failed to see_ get solved you'll be like:

![jackie chan confused](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69139607/216096870-c48fc393-e9dc-4b66-893e-1133426773d7.png)
What you need to do is turn off the filters that usually prevent you from seeing them. The most powerful is simply taking the current state of the world for granted. Even the most radically open-minded of us mostly do that. You couldn't get from your bed to the front door if you stopped to question everything.

Since we're looking for startup ideas, we can take efficiency for granted and start to question things. "Why is it like this?", "How can this get better?", "How can I do this half the steps?", and you will be able to push the technological innovations forward helping you avoid the _confused Jackie Chan_ phase from your life. Pay particular attention to things that make you annoyed.

> If something annoys you, it could be because you're living in the future.

Okay, how will I know if this is the right problem? Well, it will seem _obvious_ to us. This ultimately means that coming up with startup ideas is a question of seeing the obvious. That suggests how weird this process is: you're trying to see things that are obvious, and yet that you hadn't seen.

Don't overthink a problem, take some time **creativity is a by-product of procrastination after all.** Work on projects that seem cool, they'd help you notice ideas because this helps you naturally build things that are missing. It wouldn't seem as interesting to build something that already exists.

> Just as trying to think up startup ideas tends to produce bad ones, working on things that could be dismissed as "toys" often produces good ones.
>  
>  PG

> Live in the future and build what seems interesting.


### First principle thinking
Yeah, all of that makes sense so now let's get a course on entrepreneurship and start learning how to build a company right?  Because that is what the schools and universities of the world have taught us. We **need** a teacher to guide us through the process, **customers? pfft.**

The thing is that building a company is something that you learn best by doing, the customer is the teacher that guides you to make a good product, not a random teacher who'll tell you words, you'll mug it up and puke it all over your answer sheet.

College is a great time, an incomparable opportunity as PG puts it, to become the sort of person who gets startup ideas organically.

> The clash of domains is a particularly fruitful source of ideas. If you know a lot about programming and you start learning about some other field, you'll probably see problems that software could solve.
>  
>  PG

Instead of going and getting a summer internship at a software company go and work for a biotech company. CS majors can get an internship at a software company pretty easily but to get startup ideas, you might do better to get a summer job in some unrelated field.

> Or don't take any extra classes, and just build things. It's no coincidence that Microsoft and Facebook both got started in January. At Harvard, that is (or was) Reading Period, when students have no classes to attend because they're supposed to be studying for finals.
>  
>  PG

But don't feel like you have to build things that will become startups. That's premature optimization. Just build things. Preferably with other students.

### The unsexy startup & schlep blindness


## Evaluating the Idea

In order to evaluate any startup ideas, a simple way to do so is to answer a set of questions that'll help you not only understand the customer needs, if the problem is a good problem but also if you are the right person to do so. 

So, I blatantly copied this set of questions from YC's Startup School and listed them below. I have been working on answering them on my idea and if you want to evaluate yours, try answering these questions:

- **Founder/Market Fit**
	- Is our team the right team to build this application?
	- For example, let's say `Plangrid` is an iPad app that helps people see construction blueprints
	- A good team for this would be a founder who has worked in the construction industry and a person who knows how to build it.
	- Founder Market fit is so important that it is wise to look for an idea that fits with the founders.
- **How big is the market?**
	- Ones that are big now, and ones that are small now but are rapidly growing
	- An example of the second one is `Coinbase` which grew with the web3 train
	- How acute is this problem?
- **How acute is this problem?**
	- A problem that people don't care about, it is a made-up problem or there is just not enough reason to solve it.
	- An example of the opposite of it would be `Brex` which allowed startups to have a credit card, before if it just wasn't possible for startups to get a credit card from the banks
- **Is there any competition?**
	- Founders generally think that having competitors is a bad thing, but counterintuitively most good startup ideas already have competition.
	- But if you're going into an especially entrenched competition, then insight is necessary
- **Do you want this (the product)?**
	- Do you personally even want this product? or Do you know people personally who'll wish to this product?
	- If the answer to both of these questions is a no then well, don't start up
- **Did this only recently become possible or necessary?**
	- Something has recently changed in the industry, a new technology, a regulatory change, or a new problem
	- For example, Checker does background checks via an API. Delivery services like door dash and Uber started to take off and suddenly there was a massive increase in the number of delivery people that they required. And to do background checks on them Checker was there.
- **Are their proxies?**
	- A proxy is a large company that does something similar to your startup but is not a direct competitor
	- For example, Zomato or Swiggy, which are food delivery companies in India. But there already was UberEats present but it was not available in India.
- **Is this an idea that you want to work on for Years**
	- This is a personal question, for example not a lot of people would be excited to build tax accounting software
	- So you have to ask yourself if you are willing to work on this for years.
- **Is this scalable?**
	- Software? Yes. They are already infinitely scalable.
	- Agencies and service companies not so much.
- **Is this a good ideas space**
	- An _idea space_ is one level of abstraction out from a particular startup idea. It is a class of closely related startup ideas.
