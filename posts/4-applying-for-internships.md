So, you have been working really hard for a while now, and you think you'r ready to start applying for internships. Then
you search online and get confused, Where to apply? How to apply? Best platform? but don't give up and gather the courage to pick
one platform find a good internship with a decent pay and with opportunity to learn, and apply for that internship only
to be ghosted by them.

You get demotivated, all the confidence that you have been gathering when learning and buildng projects shatters into a
million pieces. You start question yourself, your life decisions and then start complaining.

**My friend, I got you covered ðŸ¥º**

In this blog post, we're gonna go over which one is the better platform for applying for internships
**[Cuvette](https://cuvette.tech)** or **[Angel List](https://angel.co)**, do you even **have** to choose? What is the
optimal framework for applying for internships?

And to do that we're gonna go over my approach to apply for internships. Why mine? because I have gotten shortliested
for more that 30% of the companies/startups that I have applied to our of which I have been shortlisted to more than 10
companies and have cleared interviews for 4 of them before accepting an offer from [Solvio](https://trysolvio.ai)
and because I was accepted for [GSoC 2022](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rose-kamal-love-1146141b0_gsoc-webdevelopment-intern2022-activity-6933844932365299712-4GI5?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web)
as well I didn't feel the need to apply for more.
