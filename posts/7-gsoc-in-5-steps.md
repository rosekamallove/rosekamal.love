It was during my JEE preparation (which I failed miserably) that I first got to know about [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) a wildcard to Google is what they said and by "they" I obviously mean him (Aman Dhattarwal) his video was the first introduction for me to this thing called **GSoC**.

For someone like it was more than just GSoC, for me it was hope. Hope that even if I fuck up my college entrance examinations I still have a chance at life at large, I can still get a good job, and getting into an IIT or NIT is not the only way to make a good life.

So, obviously, I thought it was a `wildcard to Google` because that's how an optimist's mind works. Give him the tiniest amount of hope and he'll believe whatever it is that gives him hope.
