It was during my JEE preparation (which I failed miserably) that I first got to know about [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) a wildcard to Google is what they said and by "they" I obviously mean him (Aman Dhattarwal) his video was the first introduction for me to this thing called **GSoC**.

For someone like me, it was more than just GSoC, for me it was hope. Hope that even if I fuck up my college entrance examinations I still have a chance at life at large, I can still get a good job, and getting into an IIT or NIT is not the only way to make a good life.

So, I believed it was a `wildcard to Google` because that's how an optimist's mind works. Give him the tiniest amount of hope and he'll believe whatever it is that gives him hope.

And in December 2020, a 17-year-old I got into college with one ambition, `making a good life for myself` so I started coding. I wanted to apply for GSoC but couldn't because being 18+ is a requirement and I would become 18 3 months after the application period ends. So, I tried for `MLH Fellowship` which I was able to get into in my first year.

So, in my second year, I applied for the `wildcard to google` (It's a joke if you still don't get it) at the [LibreHealth](https://librehealth.io) organization.

It was a pretty weird couple of weeks after I applied and the proposal was in review, I was not sure if I am going to get accepted or not so I started applying for internships and was able to get one at a startup named [BlendED](https://blended.app) (I designed the landing page btw) and on May 22 it was there, my name on the accepted list of participants on the [forum](https://forums.librehealth.io/t/congratulations-to-our-4-accepted-contributors-for-gsoc-2022-and-next-steps/4514).

I honestly can't convey in words how happy I was. I called up all my friends, my parents, and even my ex. It was truly awesome.

So, in this blog, I am going to be laying out the things that you should focus on and analyze when you decide to get into `open-source` and apply for `Google Summer of Code`

If you don't even know what Google Summer of Code even is, then I will highly recommend [reading some blogs](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq) because this blog is mainly focused on how to apply properly, and not what GSoC even is. 

Before you move forward I will highly recommend you read through the whole [Google Summer of Code](summerofcode.withgoogle.com) website including all the links to other resources.

## Analyze yourself

With more than 200 Organisations present in GSoC with so many technologies available in those organizations, it is hard to place yourself unless you have analyzed yourself. 

So, what are the parameters on which you should analyze yourself?
- Tech Stack
- Organisation Preference (Your unfair advantage) and,
- Your communication style

You'll have to start by first analyzing the tech you know, not only the programming languages that you know but also the framework and libraries, how proficient are you in those, and which ones you _enjoy_ working with. And please don't count the language you know how to print "hello world" in ðŸ˜‚

Once you know what all tech you know and how well you know them, you can then start analyzing what type of organization you wanna work on. Do you wanna work on a developer tool or a product that general people use, maybe something really specific in which you have an unfair advantage, for example, a bio class that had to take in college can help you work with a particular organization. Maybe you had a summer job working on an LMS which can give you an unfair advantage over others if you plan to work with [Oppia](https://www.oppia.org/).

> Find your unfair advantage and see where you can benefit from it the most.

But there's a catch, in the grand scheme of things your organization's preference based on this unfair advantage won't matter because you'll be working on a tiny piece of code that is going to be heavily implementation based and not all that architectural-based. 

So what matters more than your unfair advantage is how well can you communicate with the organization and do you have good compatibility with the community providing you with feedback that will ultimately be responsible for the quality of your GSoC journey.

> Pay special attention to the way you communicate with the communication.

The only way to analyze this is to be a part of multiple organizations as a community member and then finally shortlist the organization that you feel good being a part of.


## Huh, this one seems interesting

But what organization to be a part of there are like 200, well for that I would recommend first filtering out some 7 - 8 organizations based on gut feeling and then by following the above advice filtering out the main 2 - 3 organizations.

Select one year from the [past programs](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive) and then start scrolling through the organizations listed (add the language/technology you are proficient in on the search bar), don't scroll mindlessly, this is not TikTok. Read the name of the org and then read the description and ask yourself "does this seem interesting to me", and "will I see myself working on a part of this?"

If you find an organization interesting, you won't have to ask yourself these questions. The thought `huh, this seems interesting` will automatically come to your mind and that's how you'll know which organizations to add to the list. Don't shy away from adding every organization that seems interesting to you, it doesn't matter how long you want your list to be `7-8` is just a random number.

Once you have made this list, it's time to dig a little deeper into what organization you want to be a serious part of. My recommendation is to have **at most 3** and this is not a random number, anything beyond 3 is a waste of your time as well as the organization's time.

## Gotta "love" these

It's not easy to pick out these **3 organizations** that you "love" you should take plenty of time and not rush into deciding on these organizations.

To filter out the list that you made earlier, there are some parameters that _I think_ are a good enough sieve to filter out `the three`. These parameters are:
- Whether the organization returns every year
- Does it match your tech stack?
- And are you genuinely interested in contributing to whatever they're building?

One thing that I touched on before is that you should try to focus on whether you like the way a particular organization handles communication and feedback is something that you should make a part of the criteria on which you'll decide whether you're `genuinely interested` in an organization or not. Other reasons for deciding if you're interested in it or not are up to you.

The organization has to return this year for you to apply to it right? For that what you can do is see if it has been participating consistently for the past few years or not. If you can't decide on this then you can directly communicate with the organization about participation in the program. 

And the last obvious criterion is if that organization matches the technologies that you are proficient in.

## Setting up the project
## The feedback cycle
Basically, communicate -> contribute -> communicate
### The proposal
